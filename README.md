# VoiceVibe: Speech Emotion Recognition Integration

## Overview

VoiceVibe is an innovative project focused on enhancing online counseling services by integrating Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) into virtual assistants. This integration aims to bridge the gap between humans and artificial intelligence, providing a more accessible and compassionate alternative for mental health support.

## Problem Statement

Virtual assistants and chatbots, including prominent examples like ChatGPT, have made significant strides in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) through Human-in-the-Loop techniques [1]. While these assistants cater to diverse needs, our specific focus is on optimizing online counseling services. Recognizing the limitations of expressing emotions in text, we propose leveraging SER to analyze voice tone, pitch, and intonation. This integration enables users to verbally communicate with the assistant, fostering a deeper understanding of their emotional state. The ultimate goal is to build trust between users and AI, a crucial principle in HCI.

## Motivation

Online counseling services offered by virtual assistants provide a private and compassionate alternative, countering the stigma associated with seeking mental health help. Verbal communication, as opposed to text, creates a more engaging and flexible environment. Users can communicate at their convenience without time restrictions or the need for therapist appointments. While existing assistants rely on textual data for emotion analysis, our approach utilizes voice attributes for a more nuanced understanding. Personalized responses from the assistant contribute to building trust and rapport.
